&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt H., Apr. 3, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big news first: &lt;strong&gt;we have funding!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, the wire has cleared from our first major investor, and Affinity is a going concern. Several more investors have the term sheet in hand, and are expecting to close shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are especially grateful to them for their willingness to try something new in the way they are supporting this work. We are doing a couple of creative things in the way we organize and finance Affinity, in order to ensure it remains permanently focused on building progressive power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;we have organized as a worker-owned cooperative&lt;/strong&gt;. Our full legal name is “Affinity Ltd. Co-op Association”. We’ll still have a traditional management structure, but only the people working for the organization are empowered to make board-level decisions. That is meant to defend against the possibility of a buyout or takeover by a marketing firm, as has happened before to other similar projects. We’ve left open the possibility that eventually the &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; of the platform may also participate in the ownership of it, although that is a ways down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, our investors will make their money from this project via profit-sharing, rather than a big “exit” or IPO. The investment terms are such that even in the (highly unlikely) event that the organization goes public or is sold for a high value, the returns to the investors are limited to no more than they would have made through the profit sharing agreement, with anything left over being donated to charity. So, not only is there no way for investors to take over control and vote to sell the company, there is also no financial incentive to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that people are willing to put their money into this project under these unusual terms just shows how committed they are to the importance of this work for growing our movement to resist Trump and take back the country, and I can’t say enough about how much I appreciate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve been doing a LOT of talking with organizers around the country&lt;/strong&gt;, to make sure we’re building the right thing for them to use. We’re taking that to the next level this month, **partnering with Greenpeace to host an in-person meeting **on April 30 in Washington DC at the Greenpeace offices with a bunch of grassroots organizers. The plan is to do a big “design thinking” exercise with them, which will inform our product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also in conversations with one of the major Indivisible chapters, to begin hosting their list using the Action Network installation we use to build our prototypes. If that comes through, we’ll have a “customer base” with which to do lots of real-time experiments and MVP testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that customer testing will come in handy when we do our next presentation to the Matter.vc startup incubator in two weeks. We’re not officially accepted yet, but things are looking positive, and that will provide us with a great structure to organize our work for the next few months (as well as another cash infusion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of MVP’s, we did another one recently. We took the 16,000 people who signed up to use our calling tools earlier this year, and we geo-matched them to their nearest Indivisible chapter and sent them an email introducing them. We got a lot of useful feedback ranging from “I’m already a member” to “Thanks, I hadn’t heard of them!” to “I don’t use Facebook and they’re only a Facebook group.” &lt;strong&gt;We have a bunch more ideas about how to create more connections&lt;/strong&gt; which we’ll be trying out soon. I’m especially excited about this, since it’s the very beginning of the Commons which we always wanted to create!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have some other new product ideas, courtesy of our &lt;strong&gt;two founding Advisory Board members, Micah Sifry and Zack Exley.&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks you two for agreeing to give us ongoing guidance, you’ve already been invaluable brains to have in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The codebase itself has continued to grow, although slowly as we’ve been putting these other parts in place. We now have a functioning React front-end which is using real data from our Rails back-end, which is syncing information from the Action Network system. Once we turn full attention back coding next week we should have a real “track event attendance” feature live and ready to put into the hands of real-world testers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since our last update, and I promise we’ll do better in the future. As you can see, we’ve been busy; now that we’re almost able to afford going full-time on this project, you can expect the pace to increase!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please pass this along to anyone who you think might be interested in the Affinity project, and please be free with questions, comments, suggestions, critiques and ideas. We want to learn how to do this well, from any and all teachers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Update #3 Matt H., Apr. 3, 2017</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Update 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/updates/2017/02/12/update2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Update 2" /><published>2017-02-12T22:09:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-02-12T22:09:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/updates/2017/02/12/update2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/updates/2017/02/12/update2.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-2&quot;&gt;Update #2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt H., Feb. 2, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a BIG week of learning last week with the Advocacy Commons project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan led meetings with a whole bunch of Silicon Valley types – VC’s, CEO’s, heavy hitters of various stripes from his previous career as big deal in that world. Matt joined most of the meetings, and David was there too for the initial one. At least one very-well-known-but-not-named-here CEO already promised to put in money, based on Evan’s track record, and more conversations are lined up. But just as valuable as the cash were the questions and input we got, which helped us sharpen not only our pitch but our own thinking about the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were at it, we also wrote and submitted an application to Y Combinator’s new non-profit startup round. We also sent what we wrote out for comments from a number of people, and the input and group editing process again made our thinking much better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, David, Evan and Matt spent a full day locked in an office with whiteboard markers talking through specific product features. We’re ready to make the roadmap. AAAAANNNDD in the meantime, Harpo knocked it out of the park on the organizing front, connecting DailyKos together with a number of local activists and hand-delivering 77,000 messages to Senators – a great model for the kind of connections between groups and activists we want to facilitate with the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the highlights of the meetings, and details on our current plans for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Structure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three different people (Ben Werdmuller of Matter.vc, Sam McAfee formerly of Change.org and many other places, and Tom Preston-Werner formerly head of GitHub) all asked how we are structured legally, and pushed us to have a firm answer when we said “we’re thinking about it.” The options we’re considering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-profit: (+) Required for the Y Combinator program. Would look good to the activists we’re going to serve, makes it clear that we’re not in this to get rich. Opens the door to other grant funding. (-) Takes any sort of equity funding off the table. Takes more time/effort to set up, more requirements to follow in ongoing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B-Corporation: (+) Makes it clear that we’re focused on public benefit not private profit. Still a corp so can do various kinds of funding. May make it easier for people to volunteer (this according to Sam Pullara, former Yahoo VP, and now Managing Director for Sutter Hill Ventures, who recommended this model). (-) Lots of extra auditing and requirements to meet, according to the Preston-Werners, who suggested starting as a C-corp and moving to B later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C-Corporation: (+) Most standard model, easy for everyone to understand and to get legal/accounting help. Most existing activism platforms are sold this way. (-) Could make us seem like just-another-startup looking for a payout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We laid out a rough plan which is basically “With $1.5MM we could go full speed with 5-6 people, and within 18-24 months we can be self-sustaining from income.” Some people wanted more proof of that – they wanted some details on exactly where the self-sustaining income would come from. Things we discussed as possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;offering a voter file or other enhanced data “add-on” for extra fee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;having “private” spaces for a low fee like $7, like GitHub does, where you can work on your projects without public input&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;charging sliding-scale hosting fees for the SaaS organizing tools - free for small local orgs but larger groups pay the freight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;offering donation gateway services and collecting a fee on it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;having a “tip jar” a la ActBlue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan has started a pro forma budget that we’ll flesh out to prove the case that we can make this pay for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keeping it Progressive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Sam Pullara and Tom Preston-Werner and his wife Theresa wanted to know “how can you make sure the right wing doesn’t use whatever you build?”  We didn’t have a satisfactory answer to this. Sam talked a little about the fact that the license for JSON has a “Don’t use this software for evil” clause, but after doing some research I’ve discovered that it’s essentially considered an unenforceable oddity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer to Theresa Preston-Werner was “we just won’t let them use it”, the way that e.g. ActionKit doesn’t sell their tools to non-progressive groups. She found that non-convincing, which makes sense given that we had just told her it would be an open-source project…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hard Questions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one which kept coming up was “why is there a need for this,” in the form of “why don’t people just use Facebook events”, “How much better are you than the ad hoc tools people already use?” “why not just use twitter”, and “this sounds like a social network, but we already have Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know there are clear answers to these  questions. For instance, organizing a resistance event requires 6 or 8 different steps, and Facebook Events is great for pretty much just one of them: publicizing it. All the volunteer and logistical management, activity tracking, backchannel communications, collection of on-site signups, etc., has to be done some other way.  And yes we do have Facebook, but we also have a social network for working on code and other projects together (GitHub), and one for career building (LinkedIn), and one for sharing longer writing (Medium), several for parents and families, etc. etc. etc. We think that organizing for social change is a specific activity, and will be improved by networking together the people doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, clearly we’re going to need to demonstrate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE PLAN from here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to Build Real Stuff, Fast. We heard from many people in many ways that this project is right for this moment, and that the moment won’t last forever. We’re going to pick out the most useful one or two features of what we’ve drawn out, and make them work with real data, hopefully within a week. I’ll be doing a new push of customer development with the goal of getting some real-world groups using our code as soon as it’s running, for a) feedback we can use to iterate, and b) validation for funders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this space for more on exactly what the first working feature(s) will be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also Matt will be meeting with some people from Movement for Black Lives this week to learn more about the security needs of activists who have more to worry about than trolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, a reality-check: Our current top priority is landing a little “breathing space” funding. In two weeks we will hit the limit of how much we can do by living on savings and debt; if we are to keep up the pace, let alone increase, we need to solidify $20-$25K in angel contributions or loans. All suggestions and assistance welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Last Thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost forgot. We’re still using “Advocacy Commons” as a project name, but we think it’s a mouthful and not a great long-term moniker. We batted around calling it “Rebel Base”, but that doesn’t yet sit quite right. The most recent idea is “Affinity”, which has the benefit of being shorter, more “start-up-y”, and suggestive of “affinity groups”, which are the forbearers of the local grassroots groups we’ll support – but there aren’t any good domain names available for it :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestion box is open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Update #2 Matt H., Feb. 2, 2017</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Update 1</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/updates/2017/01/25/update1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Update 1" /><published>2017-01-25T19:06:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-01-25T19:06:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/updates/2017/01/25/update1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/updates/2017/01/25/update1.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-1&quot;&gt;Update #1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt H., Jan. 25, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of the happy few who are writing the initial code on the Advocacy Commons project, thank you! And if you’re one of the many who have supported the idea and offered encouragement, thanks to you too. Here’s an update on how this idea is becoming a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we’re doing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always find it useful to start by reminding myself of the ultimate goals: We’re here to support and enhance the grassroots, on-the-ground organizing happening around the United States to resist the reactionary right-wing takeover of our government. We will do that in two ways: the Tools, and the Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of the Tools is simple: all local grassroots groups have a similar set of tasks for organizing themselves, communicating with each other and the public, etc. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; cobble together a solution with google docs, etc., if you have the time and savvy and already know what you want to do. But we are going to offer a free, open-source set of simple tools to handle the most common local grassroots political organizing tasks, with best-practices built in so that even if this is your first time running a group you will find it easy to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commons has a different goal. The idea is to make it easy for grassroots groups to find and cooperate with each other, and to cooperate with large national organizations. Currently that only happens either when individual activist leaders already have personal trust relationships, or when a national group reaches out to its membership and accidentally finds leaders of pre-existing local groups. We will make it possible for people of goodwill and similar political interests to partner together and trust one another without having a previous relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who’s involved&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the goal is to support grassroots groups, it’s vital that we work WITH real, active grassroots groups during the design phase. We want to build the things they need, not the things we think they should need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been meeting with leaders of the https://www.indivisibleguide.com/ movement as a first step in this direction. Indivisible is entirely volunteer led, and they currently have about 4,000 local grassroots groups included in their directory (as well as 100,000+ individuals; unknown which individuals map to which groups, for the most part).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first step was to create a better version of their Action Network signup form, to immediately reduce their load of manual data cleaning, and to establish our bona fides as people who can solve technical problems for organizers. Props to Ben for jumping in and making that smooth and pretty. As I write this, we’re still waiting for a connection to Indivisible’s web developer in order to deploy the new, better form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to sit down with the person at Indivisible charged with managing the data about all those groups, and walk through a demo of our proposed groups management features. We learned some good stuff, such as “easy reporting tools are important”, and “we want to think in terms of congressional districts, but local groups organize themselves according to cities and neighborhoods.” We’ll post our full notes to this group soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt is meeting with local leaders of Pantsuit Nation (or rather, the spinoff group which formed after a schism in the Pantsuit Nation. We ARE lefties, after all…) next week, and Matt and Evan will meet with leaders from the Movement for Black Lives the week after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meantime, David has been meeting with local groups in the Oakland area to get their feedback on the mockups; we’ll collect his feedback and post it also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How’s the Build coming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been proceeding on three fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interface Mockups.&lt;/strong&gt; This was the work that initially got us off the ground: David’s Bootstrap + fake JSON data mockups of how the key screens might work. Based on our review of how Indivisible currently works, we added a mock of an admin screen for multiple groups, and their feedback was that it looked a lot like what they need.  These simple/quick mockups are very useful for getting user feedback; we should keep using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**React + Node Mockups: **Taking it one step further, Ben has re-created some of the interface mockups using React, though still pulling data from a faked-up JSON. Props to the nice design he’s applied to it, these are looking like a professional web app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Rails app: **The lead here is Rabble, and his task is creating the data models which can feed real information into those React components. Major progress here this week getting an admin interface so all the data is available through a good interface for group admins, adding a zipcode lookup service, and trying to sort out the jsonapi to back both react and add osdi support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next step&lt;/strong&gt; is to recreate David’s new Groups Admin mockup in a React version, and connect it to real data in Rabble’s backend. Then Matt will work to get a sample of live Indivisible data to insert into the database. At that point we can pitch really using this single feature to Indivisible – if they like the idea, that might give us two directions to pursue:
	- We build the data connector to put &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the real Indivisible data into our system. They currently use Action Network but may switch to something else; whatever it is, it will be useful to us to have a connector to work with it. And once it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work, we have a shot at our first big organizational user.
	- It gives us a much better demo for raising funds. Showing a functional front end + back end system, with real data, and an endorsement from a currently-famous grassroots group, should help our efforts significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of funding. We’re all doing this because we care about the direction of the country, but we all also have to eat. For this project to have long-term impact, it has to be sustainable. Our current plan is to make the code for the Tools open source, available for anyone to download and install. However we realize that this is still beyond the ability of many of the local grassroots groups we wish to empower. So, we will also offer the Tools as “Software as a Service”. We envision a sliding-scale fee structure with free service for small organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven’t yet settled on an income model for the Commons, but the experience of the past decade shows that once a marketplace has been created where people and groups interact, there is usually a financial component that can be tapped to make the system sustainable. Maybe large organizations will find it sufficiently valuable to pay a fee; maybe we’ll integrate fundraising tools for grassroots groups and collect a small percentage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we’ll be seeking startup funding from at least three sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angel investors:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve come a long way already on strictly volunteer help, but soon we’ll need at least a little financial runway. We think we can find that from a few high net worth individuals who are ideologically motivated and have personal trust relationships with the principals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundations:&lt;/strong&gt; We believe that the Tools, in particular, are easy to explain to ideologically-aligned foundations. We think the combination of the pedigree of the project founders in both activism and tech, along with the endorsements we plan to compile from existing groups, will be convincing to grant-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech startup investors:&lt;/strong&gt; We think the Commons, in particular, is a model which is familiar to Silicon Valley types. From a certain angle, this is a startup based on a dis-intermediation business model. Take a process which has historically been complex, slow, and reliant on personal connections, and make it transparent, streamlined, and based on a reputation marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Evan will meet with potential investors and donors during the month of February&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How we’re organizing ourselves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Slack channel is getting more active these days, and the tech work has expanded to the point that we have a new Trello board to keep track of it. There are still only a handful of us, so this is a flat, consensus-based group – do as much, or as little, as you feel, and if you disagree with the way things are happening speak up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt&lt;/strong&gt; is focusing mostly on the product vision and making relationships with potential users. &lt;strong&gt;Rabble&lt;/strong&gt; is focusing mostly on the technical architecture and the tech-world fundraising approach. Anyone else who wants to raise their hand and say “I’d like to be the go-to person for &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;_____”, now is your moment. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Update #1 Matt H., Jan. 25, 2017</summary></entry></feed>
