      <p> The country is on fire with activist groups resisting the emerging <span
          class="hilight">threats
          to American democracy</span>. It's inspiring and exciting, but some
        activists tell us it's also challenging to manage all those people and
        actions!</p>
      <p>Affinity.works is a team of veteran activist/coders who are making <span
          class="hilight">open-source
          tools to solve current grassroots organizing problems</span>. We
        envision a more connected, efficient and flexible organizing world,
        where responsive, intersectional coalitions can more easily form and
        collaborate.</p>

    <div class="about">
      <h3>Solving current problems for grassroots organizers</h3>
      <div class="subtitle">
        <p> <span class="hilight">There is no simple technological solution to
            social problems,</span> but social movements can use technology to
          manage their day-to-day work and magnify their impact â€“ especially
          when that tech is <span class="hilight">responsive to the actual
            needs of actual organizers.</span> </p>
        <p> We come to this project with decades of organizing experience from
          digital to grassroots. We also know that the new social movements need
          tools which reflect the reality of how they work and help them be more
          effective. Affinity uses design thinking and lean techniques in
          partnership with organizers to identify and solve concrete problems. </p>
